# crop_circle_map

I have used crop circles in this map purely because it's the only data I could find online that contained coordinates. My original intentions were to create a map that gave the location of Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) in Wiltshire but sadly the coordinates for these are not easily accessible. 

The population figures are based on data from 2005 and are here just to show the potential of layers that can be added to a map using Folium.

I have created a map that shows crop circles that were reported in 2009, the map also shows the world population in a polygon layer. Both the markers for crop circles and the world population can be toggled on and off.

The marker colours represent the type of crop that the circle was made in and the population colours also change depending on how densely populated that country is.
